This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

`styled-components` is used for css-in-js

`react-form` is used to make it easy to deal with potential future common form tasks. EG: no need to write `event.preventDefault()`, complex form validations and submit to the backend etc.

Other things that listed on the requirement should be done on the backend. EG: use Email providers

Things that can be added in the future:

- [ ] reCAPTCHA
- [ ] Send this email with different services. EG: Gmail or outlook.
